GALLERY


$self->Log();

colour individual host terminals
generic perllll script that does searches in foreign/, lib etc (???)

Rework gallery display into separate js file - done for single subject page 
*Role::DB - prepare_cached as standard is probably a mistake and at least the warning should be supressed
